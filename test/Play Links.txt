To setup and run Shadence in production on Amazon micro instance
- Installed OpenJDK 1.7 (as javac was not present in the Amazon AMI)
- Made sure that default java executable pointed to java7, to avoid java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError
- Added (export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms175M -Xmx175M") to play executable, before if-else starts
